# App-Profitability-Analysis
This guided project details my steps in cleaning and filtering data from the App Store and GooglePlay. By doing so, I was able to analyze what type of app was successful in each store based on its genre, reviews, installations, etc. In the end, it provided enough data to decide what new application would likely be profitable on both platforms.
